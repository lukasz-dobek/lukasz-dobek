Higher beings, these words are for you alone.
Your great strength marks you amongst us. 
Focus your soul and you shall achieve feats of which others can only dream.

🔭 I’m currently developing Service Level Objectives platform at Nobl9, helping people to be **good enough**. \
🎙️ I enjoy speaking at conferences (such as SLOconf), and helping out at events such as hackathons. \
🌱 I’m currently learning stoicism, leadership, Kubernetes, and how to water my plants. \
💬 Ask me about software development, how to pronounce my name, working at startup, or AWS stuff. \
